# To develop the project, the following processes were implemented:

1. jQuery was used to develop the basic functionality of the application

2. The Google books API was used to generate search results for the user's author/title search, the rating of a given title, a description of the plot, and an image of the cover
3. The Good Reads API was used to generate a purchase link for a given title
4. Materialize and Bootstrap were used for styling
5. Dayjs was utilized to log the date of the search
6. Font awesome was utilized for styling all fonts
