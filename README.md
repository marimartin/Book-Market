Book Market Place

Book Marketplace is a quick and convenient platform for users to source a book.

The application has the following features:
1. Allows the user to search for any author or book title
2. Provides a rating and a description for a given book

2. The Google books API was used to generate search results for the user's author/title search, the rating of a given title,  a description of the plot, and an image of the cover
3. The Good Reads API was used to generate a purchase link for a given title 
4. Materialize and Bootstrap were used for styling
5. Dayjs was utilized to log the date of the search 
6. Font awesome was utilized for styling all fonts
